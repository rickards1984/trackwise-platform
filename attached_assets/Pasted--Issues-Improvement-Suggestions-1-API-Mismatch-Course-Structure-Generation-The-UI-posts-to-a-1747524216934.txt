❌ Issues & Improvement Suggestions
1. ❌ API Mismatch: Course Structure Generation
The UI posts to /api/ai/generate-structure, but your reviewed backend route was:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/course-builder/generate-structure
✅ Fix the endpoint in handleGenerateStructure:

ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch('/api/course-builder/generate-structure', {
2. ❗ Missing Standard ID in Course Structure Request
In your UI request:

ts
Copy
Edit
body: JSON.stringify({ 
  ksbElements: ksbData,
  standardTitle: standardInfo?.title,
  ...
})
➡️ But the backend route expects standardId.

✅ Add:

ts
Copy
Edit
standardId: selectedStandard,
3. ⚠️ KSB ID Extraction Bug
Your UI tries to extract ids from KSBs but StandardInfo doesn't include them:

ts
Copy
Edit
const ksbIds: number[] = [];
// But you map .code and .description, not .id
✅ Fix:

Ensure KSBs returned by /analyze-standard and /apprenticeship-standards/:id include id field.

Else backend recommendation request will fail.

4. 🔁 Repeated Code
Duplicate logic in handleLoadStandard and handleAnalyzeStandard:

Normalize into loadStandardInfo(data) function

5. 🧱 Component Decomposition (Scalability)
You’re approaching 1000+ lines in a single component. Suggested refactors:

Component	Suggested File
KSBSelectionAccordion	components/KSBSelectionAccordion.tsx
StandardSummaryCard	components/StandardInfoCard.tsx
ResourcesPanel	components/ResourcesTab.tsx
ModalViewer	components/KSBDetailModal.tsx

6. 🧠 UX Win: Pre-Select All KSBs
When user loads a standard, offer a toggle:

"Pre-select all KSBs?" (useful when tutors want full coverage)

ts
Copy
Edit
if (autoSelectAll) {
  setSelectedKsbs([
    ...data.knowledge.map(k => k.code),
    ...data.skills.map(s => s.code),
    ...data.behaviors.map(b => b.code)
  ]);
}
7. 💾 Auto-Save Draft Support (Stretch)
Store user’s progress:

LocalStorage OR /api/course-builder/drafts

Resumes where they left off
