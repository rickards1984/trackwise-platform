✅ What’s Done Well
Area	✅ Strength
Auth Guard	Protected via requireAuth middleware — good for compliance
Parameter Checks	Validates academicYear & returnPeriod exist
Namespace XML Format	Starts with proper <Message> root, includes xsi and xmlns attributes
Header Fields	Populates Collection, Year, FilePreparationDate, UKPRN — all ILR essentials
React UI Export Trigger	Clean Button that opens export in new tab via /api/ilr/export?...

❌ Improvements Needed
1. ❗Hardcoded UKPRN
ts
Copy
Edit
const ukprn = "10004300"; // hardcoded
✅ Fix:

Fetch from provider profile (e.g. req.session.user.provider.ukprn)

Or DB: await storage.getProviderSettingsByUser(req.session.userId)

2. ❌ Incomplete XML Structure
You're only outputting:

xml
Copy
Edit
<Message><Header>...</Header></Message>
❌ But for ILR submission, must include:

<Learner> blocks

<LearningDelivery>

<LearningDeliveryFAM>

<EmploymentStatus>

✅ Fix:

Pull learner data from DB:

ts
Copy
Edit
const learners = await storage.getIlrLearners(academicYear, returnPeriod);
Loop and build full learner payload:

xml
Copy
Edit
<Learner>
  <LearnRefNumber>...</LearnRefNumber>
  <ULN>...</ULN>
  <FamilyName>...</FamilyName>
  ...
</Learner>
🧠 Bonus: Use a templating lib like xmlbuilder2 or xml-js for clarity.

3. ⚠️ Response Type Not Set
You’re generating XML, but not telling the browser.

✅ Fix:

ts
Copy
Edit
res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/xml");
res.setHeader("Content-Disposition", `attachment; filename="ILR_${academicYear}_R${returnPeriod}.xml"`);
4. ⚠️ Static Filename
It's always downloaded as download.xml unless you force Content-Disposition.

✅ Suggested Format:

txt
Copy
Edit
ILR-10004300-2024-25-R01.xml
5. 🧪 Validation Warning (Missing Schema)
Currently, no validation against ILR XSD schema.

✅ Future Improvement:

Validate XML with libxmljs2 or external ILR schema file

Log compliance errors before export

6. 🔁 Frontend Export Parameters
This is fine:

ts
Copy
Edit
window.open(`/api/ilr/export?academicYear=2024-25&returnPeriod=01`);
But should use dynamic values:

Get selected year from state

Allow export of historical ILRs too

### ✅ ILR XML Export Route Review

- [ ] 🔐 Fetch `UKPRN` dynamically from provider profile or DB
- [ ] 🔁 Query learners from DB (`storage.getIlrLearners(...)`)
- [ ] 🧱 Loop & construct full `<Learner>` XML block per ESFA ILR schema
- [ ] 📄 Set headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/xml`
  - `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ILR-UKPRN-YEAR-RXX.xml"`
- [ ] (Future) Add XML schema validation before export
- [ ] (UI) Pass selected year/returnPeriod from frontend state, not hardcoded
